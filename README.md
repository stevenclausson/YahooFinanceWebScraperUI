# YahooFinanceWebScraperUI
<br />
My first web scraper. It's a console app, so don't expect anything fancy. I tried to make one with Lowes for prices, but I don't think Lowes like that, and I have hardly any idea what I'm doing. I am using VS2022 CE, also using the Nuget package HtmlAgilityPack. Really interesting package. 
Hopefully will upate this more as I go along. Eventually want the user to enter a stock and have it display the current price and trend. After that I think I'm going to be completed. 
I understand many websites don't like web scrapers, so I don't know if there's much use for them anymore. I'm just new to C# and this seemed like a cool project.

I just used the official HtmlAgilityPack documentation for this application. It's honestly all in the main Program file. Oof, I know. When I learn some better coding habits I will fix it with classes and all that smooth jazz.
